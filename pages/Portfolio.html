                <h3>Thesis; test evaluations</h3>
                <p>
                    My thesis is about doing <em>test evaluations</em> and giving <em>feedback</em> to students on their progress. I find that my students don't have the attention to listen to me explaining how they should have made their test. They will ask the same questions over and over and they mostly want to convince me that their answer is worth more point than I have given them. <br>
                    I am doing a design study with my students to find a better approach on doing test evaluations. The main question is: What does a test evaluation look like where students gain insights on their progress? The specifics are listed in the actual thesis.
