        <p>Welcome to my website! I am Servaas Winder, my day job is being a physics teacher. On this website you will find my curriculum vitae, a portfolio of my work (you will need a password to get access) and some personal information about my hobbies.</p>

      <h2>Educational master in physics</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Servaas Winder and I was born and raised in North Holland, but currently I live in Leiden. After completing my Bachelor's degree in Physics Education at the HvA, I started the Master's program in Physics Education at Fontys Tilburg. I have been working as a physics teacher at the Northgo College in Noordwijk for 4 years.

      <p>
        My interest in teaching physics began with the MAVO, but I now have experience in teaching HAVO and VWO. Currently, I specialize in teaching VWO and I find modeling to be particularly enjoyable. In addition, I also teach O&O/Technasium.
      </p>

      <p>  
        Although I have not conducted research at the university level, I have carried out a didactic design study on post-test discussion. I believe it is important to continue to develop myself and seek inspiration. One of my favorite sources of inspiration is Destin's YouTube channel, Smarter Every Day, where he talks about all sorts of cool things.
      </p>

      <p>
        One challenge I see for students studying physics is that the subject is still perceived as difficult, even compared to other subjects or studies. I want to show my students that it's not as hard as it seems and help them overcome these challenges by encouraging them to reflect on their work as much as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to my passion for physics, I enjoy photography, tinkering with electronics and code, and I also like to ride motorcycles. I am always looking for new challenges and ways to inspire myself and others.
