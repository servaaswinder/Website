        <p>Welcome to my website! I am Servaas Winder, my day job is being a physics teacher. On this website you will find my curriculum vitae, a portfolio of my work (you will need a password to get access) and some personal information about my hobbies.</p>

      <h2>Educational master in physics</h2>
      <p>
        My <em>educational bachelors</em> in <em>physics</em> and <em>chemistry</em> started in 2013, it took me 6 years
        to finnish both. With those two bachelors im allowed to teach the undergraduate students from age 13 to 16.
        Since then I have had plenty of experience with this group to understand that I feel most at home with the older
        students teaching them more complex physics. With these students de curriculum is more context driven. For
        example: at age 15 I can teach them how household electricity works and how to work on that safely or better jet
        at age 17 I can teach about de <em>large hadron collider</em>. But at age 13 I am limited to teaching the basics
        like how to take measurements and what velocity is.
        In 2021 I decided to enroll in the <em>educational master</em>, a two year program. With this I am allowed to
        teach the graduate students up to age 19 years old.
