				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>I'm Servaas Winder, a physics teacher at the Northgo-college in Noordwijk. I specialize in teaching VWO physics and I enjoy modeling. In addition to physics, I also teach O&O/Technasium. Outside of work, I enjoy photography, tinkering with electronics and code, and riding motorcycles.</p>

		<h2>Educational master in physics</h2>
      	<p>	
        My name is Servaas Winder and I was born and raised in North Holland, but currently I live in Leiden. After completing my Bachelor's degree in Physics Education at the HvA, I started the Master's program in Physics Education at Fontys Tilburg. I have been working as a physics teacher at the Northgo College in Noordwijk for 4 years.

        My interest in teaching physics began with the MAVO, but I now have experience in teaching HAVO and VWO. Currently, I specialize in teaching VWO and I find modeling to be particularly enjoyable. In addition, I also teach O&O/Technasium.

		Although I have not conducted research at the university level, I have carried out a didactic design study on post-test discussion. In this study, I investigated the impact of test feedback on students' learning outcomes. I believe that providing constructive feedback on student tests is crucial for their further development and growth. To help my students improve their performance, I devote significant time and attention to post-test discussions in my classes.

		I believe that continuous self-improvement and seeking inspiration are important for personal and professional growth. As an educator, I find inspiration in a variety of sources, but one of my favorites is Destin's YouTube channel, Smarter Every Day. Here, he discusses all sorts of fascinating topics and presents a fresh and engaging perspective on the world.

      	<p>
        One challenge I see for students studying physics is that the subject is still perceived as difficult, even compared to other subjects or studies. I want to show my students that it's not as hard as it seems and help them overcome these challenges by encouraging them to reflect on their work as much as possible.
      	</p>

      	<p>
        In addition to my passion for physics, I enjoy photography, tinkering with electronics and code, and I also like to ride motorcycles. I am always looking for new challenges and ways to inspire myself and others.
